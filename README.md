Device Configuration: The model will utilize CUDA if a GPU is available, otherwise it will use the CPU.

1) Data Preprocessing: It uses StandardScaler to standardize the features and convert them into PyTorch tensors.
2) Neural Network Architecture: A simple feed-forward neural network with one hidden layer.
3) Training: The model is trained for 100 epochs using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.
4) Evaluation: The model's accuracy is evaluated on both the training and test datasets.


 1.   Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - **Dataset**: The dataset used here is the **Breast Cancer dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`. This dataset contains features of cell nuclei (e.g., radius, texture, smoothness) extracted from breast cancer images, with the goal of classifying whether the tumor is **malignant (1)** or **benign (0)**.
   
   - **Data Splitting**: The dataset is split into two parts:
     - **Training Set**: This portion of the data will be used to train the neural network model.
     - **Test Set**: This portion of the data will be used to evaluate the model's performance.
   
   - **Standardization**: The features (i.e., X data) are standardized using `StandardScaler`. This ensures that the features have zero mean and unit variance, which is important for neural networks because it helps the optimization algorithm converge faster.

   - **Tensor Conversion**: After standardization, the data is converted into **PyTorch tensors** so that it can be processed efficiently by the model. The tensors are then moved to the GPU if available (using `.to(device)`), which can significantly speed up the training process.

 2. **Neural Network Architecture**
   - The architecture is a **feed-forward neural network** (also known as a **multi-layer perceptron**), composed of:
     - **Input Layer**: The input size is 30, corresponding to the 30 features in the dataset.
     - **Hidden Layer**: A fully connected layer with **64 hidden neurons**. This layer is followed by a **ReLU activation function**, which introduces non-linearity to the model. The choice of ReLU is common because it helps the network to learn faster and reduces the risk of vanishing gradients.
     - **Output Layer**: The output layer has **1 neuron** (because it's a binary classification problem) and uses the **Sigmoid activation function** to output a value between 0 and 1. The closer the value is to 1, the more likely the tumor is malignant; the closer it is to 0, the more likely it is benign.

 3. **Training the Neural Network**
   - **Loss Function**: We use the **Binary Cross-Entropy Loss** (BCELoss) since it's a binary classification task. BCELoss measures how well the predicted probabilities match the true binary labels (0 or 1).
   
   - **Optimizer**: The **Adam optimizer** is used for optimization. Adam is an adaptive learning rate optimizer, meaning it adjusts the learning rate during training to improve performance and convergence.
   
   - **Training Loop**: The model is trained for 100 epochs (iterations through the entire dataset):
     - In each epoch, the optimizer computes the gradient of the loss with respect to the model's parameters and updates the parameters using backpropagation.
     - After each forward pass, the predicted output is compared with the actual target (labels), and the loss is calculated.
     - The accuracy of the model is computed by comparing the predicted labels (rounded to 0 or 1) with the actual labels.

   - Every 10 epochs, the model prints the **current loss** and **accuracy** on the training set, providing an indication of the model's learning progress.

 4. **Model Evaluation**
   - After training, the model is evaluated on both the **training set** and the **test set**:
     - **Training Evaluation**: The modelâ€™s performance is checked on the data it has seen during training. This is to ensure that the model hasn't overfitted and can generalize to unseen data.
     - **Test Evaluation**: The model's performance is then evaluated on the **test set**. The test set contains data that the model has never seen before, so this gives us a good measure of how well the model can generalize to new, unseen data.

 5. **Results**
   - After training and evaluating, the model outputs:
     - **Accuracy on the Training Set**: This shows how well the model performs on the data it was trained on.
     - **Accuracy on the Test Set**: This indicates how well the model can generalize to new data.
   
   The model prints the accuracy on the test data, which is typically the final performance measure used to assess its effectiveness.

Summary of Key Points:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Standardization, splitting, and converting to PyTorch tensors.
- **Neural Network Architecture**: A simple 2-layer neural network with ReLU and Sigmoid activations.
- **Optimization**: Using the Adam optimizer and Binary Cross-Entropy loss.
- **Evaluation**: Training accuracy and test accuracy to ensure the model generalizes well.

 Final Goal:
The model is trained to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors, predicting whether a tumor is cancerous or not based on various features derived from cell images. By the end of training, the model should have high accuracy, making it useful in real-world breast cancer detection applications.
